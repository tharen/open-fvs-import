Subject: Miscellaneous changes in the FVS-ORGANON variants
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 11/06/2017
Variants affected: OC and OP

Description: Continued enhancement of the OC and OP variants, so they produce answers consistent with the
stand-alone ORGANON growth and yield model (also see bulletins 2017.08.03_gdixon.txt and 2017.09.14_gdixon.txt).
Changes included in this group include:

1) Developer and funding credits in the Organon table headings have been made model-type specific to match those
   in Organon output.

2) Updated the Swiss Needle Cast growth modifier equations to 4/8/15 versions.

3) Corrected an error in the Organon height growth subroutine so western hemlock uses the white fir equation 
   in the SWO model type.

4) Added a new keyword (ORGMCW) to allow users to select use of Organon crown width estimates for treelist 
   output reporting, canopy cover calculations, and any other places crown widths are used in FVS.

Impact on users: Projections will be different. Users of these two variants should obtain a new executable. 

Files:
/bin/FVSoc_sourceList.txt  Added subroutine ORGMCW

/bin/FVSop_sourceList.txt  Added subroutine ORGMCW

/common/ORGANON.F77        Added the LORGCW logical variable.

/base/src exorganon.f      Added the ORGMCW entry point 

/base/src cwidth.f         Added the call to ORGMCW; variable IRTN has a value of 1 if the crown width
                           for the tree was computed using the Organon crown width equations. 

/oc/src/cratet.f           Added Organon species group to the argument list in the call to subroutine ORGSPC.

/oc/src/dgdriv.f           Added Organon species group to the argument list in the call to subroutine ORGSPC.

/oc/src/grinit.f           Initialized LORGCW to .FALSE.

/oc/src/orgspc.f           Added the Organon species group mapping to this subroutine.

/op/src/cratet.f           Added Organon species group to the argument list in the call to subroutine ORGSPC.

/op/src/dgdriv.f           Added Organon species group to the argument list in the call to subroutine ORGSPC.

/op/src/grinit.f           Initialized LORGCW to .FALSE.

/op/src/orgspc.f           Added the Organon species group mapping to this subroutine.

/organon/src/growth_mods.f Updated the Swiss Needle Cast growth modifier equations to 4/8/15 versions.
                           
/organon/src/htgrowth.f    Corrected line 666 so western hemlock uses the white fir equation in the SWO model type.

/organon/src/orgtab.f      Credits for model developers and funding sources were made to be specific to model-type.

/organon/src/orin.f        Added ORGMCW keyword to set logical variable LORGCW = .TRUE.

/organon/src/varget.f      Added logical variable LORGCW

/organon/src/varput.f      Added logical variable LORGCW

/organon/src/vols.f        Added Organon species group to the argument list in the call to subroutine ORGSPC.
