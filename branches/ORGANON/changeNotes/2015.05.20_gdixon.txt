Subject: Revamping the two FVS-Organon variants for production use
Name: Gary Dixon
Date: 05/20/2015
Variants affected: OC, OP, and PN

Description: The OC and OP are variants incorporate the ORGANON growth model into FVS using the CA and PN
variants, respectively, as the starting points. The OC variant incorporates the ORGANON Southwest Oregon model type;
the OP variant the ORGANON Northwest Oregon and Stand Management Co-op model types. The resulting code is now being 
revamped to eliminate errors, make available the full array of FVS keyword options, and revamp the code conform to 
established code standards for ease of maintainence and updating.

Impact on users: None

Files:
fire/base/src
   fmr6fall.f  added OP variant to the variable settings; changed 709 (BLM Eugene) from WA to OR in location
  
organon/src
  ORGANON.F77  took out variables that were typed but not included in the COMMON list

oc/src
   PRGPRM.F77  made line endings CR/LF consistent
     cratet.f  Added lower height limit for Organon trees; revised the tree indexing for unloading Organon dubbed value estimates
     crown.f   removed a commented out debug write statement
     dgdriv.f  Took out a tab character; added a debug write statement
     morts.f   added check to make sure organon mortality estimate does not exceed the prob value

op/src
   PRGPRM.F77  made line endings CR/LF consistent
     cratet.f  Added lower height limit for Organon trees; revised the tree indexing for unloading Organon dubbed value estimates
     crown.f   removed a commented out debug write statement
     dgdriv.f  Changed madrone species mapping to itself (valid species in this variant); added 2 debug write statements; took out
               a tab character; made the thinning test the same as in OC\src\dgdriv
     dgf.f     added a decimal point to the last value in the OBSERV array
     morts.f   included organon trees in climate sdi check; added check to make sure organon mortality estimate does not exceed
               the prob value

pn/src
      htdbh.f  corrected an error with Douglas-fir for forest code 712 (affects both PN and OP)
