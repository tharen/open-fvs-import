= Introduction =

This Wiki entry provides a brief overview of the testing scheme we have developed. There will be changes in this protocol as the development of open-fvs progresses. Your input is welcome.

= Getting the Necessary Tools =

You will need Administrator privileges to install the necessary tools, so ensure you have that before proceeding.

The tests make use of standard Unix utilities: `make, echo, grep, diff` and `rm`, so carrying out the tests on Unix platforms requires no additional tools. Carrying out tests on Windows systems requires versions of these utilities that have been ported to Windows. There are two packages of free utilities that you may wish to install.

*MinGW/MSys option*

The first package is recommended if you are building FVS with the MinGW toolchain, and is available as an optional component of the suite of MinGW utilities. Follow the steps shown here ([BuildProcess_MinGW]) to download, install and use the MinGW installer (mingw-get-setup.exe). In addition to the compiling tools, select "Basic Setup" and then choose the msys-base components as shown here:

[http://open-fvs.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/MinGWb.png]

This will download and install the additional utilities to the MinGW installation directory.

You will then need to modify the Windows *PATH* variable to make use of the new utilities, adding this directory:

{{{
C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin
}}}

One way to do this is to right-click the _My Computer_ icon on the Windows desktop and select Properties. Click the Advanced tab, then the Environment Variables button. Locate *PATH* or *Path* from either the User variables or System variables, then click Edit. At the end of the current set of PATH directories add "; C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin". Then click OK buttons until you get back to the desktop.

*rTools option*

The second package is recommended if you are already using rTools to build FVS; in which case the utilities are installed already. [TODO: complete documentation].

= Running Tests =

There is a `tests` directory under the `trunk`. It contains a directory for each FVS program that can be built in the open-fvs system. It also contains a directory called `ODBC` which contains sub directories for testing two databases, Access and SQLite3. 

Inside each sub directory there is a makefile that runs all the tests that are stored in that directory. To run the tests, simply run make:

{{{
make all
}}}

The each of the tests in the make file is run generally using the following steps:

  # An FVS program is run using an input file. Sometimes the test is run using a response file to answer the traditional prompts and sometimes it is run using command line arguments to specify the keyword file or other arguments.
  # `grep` may be used to find specific lines in the output that will be compared with saved _correct_ output.
  # `diff` is run to compare the newly created output with output that is saved and the differences are displayed.

= Correct Output =

The correct output for each test is stored in a file that has `.save` as its suffix. Note that this output has been deemed correct by the team member who committed the `.save` file the repository. It is important to understand that this output was run on one of the supported computer systems and output you get using a different system may be equally correct but different. Review the magnitude of the differences and decide for yourself if the tests pass or that an error has occurred that needs to be addressed.

= Creating Tests =

A step in the development process is to add to the test library. There are a few steps to follow:

  # Inspect the current tests, pick a pattern to follow (there are several approaches), and construct your tests using what you consider to be the best approach. Be thrifty, these tests will become part of the routine set and will be run thousands of times. But don't be too thrifty, include tests that should be run!
  # Add entries to the `makefile` as needed; build new makefiles if needed. 
  # Run your tests and establish the _correct output_. Rename the output file by adding `.save` as the suffix.
  # Commit the new tests and `.save` file to the repository. Remember to commit new versions of the `.save` file if you make changes in FVS that result in new _correct output_. 

= Operating System-Dependent Tests =

  * Tests of the Access data base (in `tests/ODBC`) rely on the Windows operating system with MS Office installed. [*TODO - Resolve the following conjecture by building and testing* The CPU-type for the FVS build must match the CPU-type of the MS Office installation. ODBC output from a 32-bit FVS build is compatible only with a 32-bit Office installation; likewise for 64-bit.]   
  * Tests of the SQLite3 data base (in `tests/ODBC`) rely on having SQLite3 ODBC drivers installed on your system.
