<p><b>FVSOnline</b> is an interface to the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/">Forest Vegetation Simulator</a>.</p>

<h5>Hints for first time users:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Use the default input database while learning, load your own data 
      once you're comfortable using the interface. Note that there is a command under the 
      <b>Tools</b> menu that lets you delete all runs and related outputs so you can easily
      start fresh with your own data.</li>
  <li>Use default settings and options until you need to change them.</li> 
</ul>

<h4>Top menu items</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Runs: </b>Set up and make FVS simulations; the outputs go to a database.</li>
  <li><b>Process Outputs: </b>Make tables, graphs and reports using the outputs from previous runs.</li>
  <li><b>Input Database: </b>Load (or edit) the input database.</li>
  <li><b>Tools: </b>Access commands to download data, update software, and delete all runs.</li>
  <li><b>Help: </b>Display this help.</li>            
</ul>


<h4>Runs</h4>
<p>To build and make a run, first select <b>Stands</b> and then 
add <b>Components</b> (using the secondary menu on the right). Stands are the
simulation units defined in the input database and components are sets of FVS commands 
(also called keywords) that that instruct FVS to invoke options or to simulate 
management activities. The stands and components will be added to the <b>Contents</b> 
list on the left. The first step is selecting stands is to select the FVS variant
you wish to use.</p>

<p><b>Components</b> are accessed by first selecting component type:<ul>
  <li><b>Management</b> for specifying management actions</li>            
  <li><b>Modifiers</b> for specify changes in the FVS predictions</li>                       
  <li><b>Outputs</b> for FVS output controls</li>                     
  <li><b>Keywords</b> for direct access to all FVS keywords</li>
  <li><b>Your components</b> to access components you build or load (using Build
      Components).</li>                                              
</ul>                                                  

<p>The <b>Time</b> scope of a simulation is automatically set to 50 or 100 years 
in 5 or 10 years cycles, both depending on the variant. The parameters of time 
can be edited and specific years you want included in the simulation can be specified
as a list of years.</p> 

<p><b>Run</b> simulations while you wait (great for under 20 stands or so), or
in the background as a separate process. Use the checkboxes to specify sets of outputs 
without having to know the keywords needed to get the outputs you desire. You can also
select alternative run scripts; these are used to implement alternative 
models within the FVS framework.</p> 

<p><b>Build Components</b> is used to build or upload FVS keyword sets
(sometimes called .kcp files). You name them and you can use add them to simulations
as you wish.</p>

<h4>Process Outputs</h4>
<p>To review the output, first, <b>Load Output</b>, 
select the database tables you wish to explore, then <b>Explore Data</b>. 
Make <b>Tables</b> and <b>Graphs</b> for selected variables and filter the 
observations by selecting stands, years, species, and other elements. If you 
want to directly query the output database, you can specify a <b>Custom Query</b>
that is run on the output   
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite3</a> database.</p>
<p>Tables and graphs can be added to a <b>report</b>, and tables can be 
directly downloaded as .csv files. Reports and be built and down loaded
as Microsoft Word .docx files.</p>

<h4>Input Database</h4>
<p>You can <b>Replace the existing database</b> by uploading an FVS-Ready 
database that is stored as a SQLite3 database (use the file suffix .db) or as 
a Microsoft Access database (.mdb or .accdb). The built-in training data or a 
blank database can be installed without uploading a file.</p> 

<p>You can <b>Upload and insert new rows</b> to existing database tables. This
is done by uploading a .csv file that contains column headings that are also
in the existing database tables. Columns in the .csv file that are not in the
existing table are ignored. Columns in the existing table that have no values
in the .csv file are left null.</p>

<p>You can <b>View and edit existing tables</b>. Use the <b>Edit</b> mode to change
values or delete rows. Make the changes and then <b>Commit</b> them to the 
database. Use the <b>New rows</b> mode to add new rows.</p>
